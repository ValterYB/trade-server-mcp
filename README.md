A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that connects your AI assistant
to a YourBourse Trade Server. Ask it to check your account, pull live quotes, and place or manage
orders — no scripts, no copy-pasting API responses. Brokers get a server-wide **admin mode** too.

## ▶ Get started

You'll be talking to your trading account through your AI assistant in about **10 minutes, with no coding**.
**Pick how you want to install** — each option below expands to a complete, screenshot-by-screenshot walkthrough.

> **Everything below is free and installs in a few clicks.** Each method lists exactly what it needs — the one-click `.mcpb` is the lightest (just [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)); the manual path adds [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) + [git](https://git-scm.com); Codex uses its own app plus [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (for `npx`).

<details>
<summary><b>📦 Claude Desktop — one-click <code>.mcpb</code> extension (easiest) · screenshot walkthrough</b></summary>

<br>

For traders **and** managers/brokers — no Node, git, or config file needed. One form (login + password); the extension detects your role automatically when it signs in. **Managers: use your admin API address.**

**Download** `trade-server-mcp.mcpb` from the [latest release](https://github.com/yourbourse/trade-server-mcp/releases/latest) (under **Assets**), then in Claude Desktop:

1. **Settings → Extensions** (under **Desktop app**) → **Advanced settings**

   ![Extensions settings](docs/images/mcpb-setup/01-extensions.png)

2. **Extension Developer → Install Extension**

   ![Install Extension](docs/images/mcpb-setup/02-install-extension.png)

3. Select the downloaded **`trade-server-mcp.mcpb`**

   ![Choose the .mcpb file](docs/images/mcpb-setup/03-choose-file.png)

4. Review (**Version 2.2.0** or later — manager support and auto-detection need 2.2.0+ — and "All requirements met") → **Install**

   ![Extension preview](docs/images/mcpb-setup/04-preview-install.png)

5. Confirm the **"Install Extension?"** prompt → **Install**

   ![Confirm install](docs/images/mcpb-setup/05-confirm-install.png)

6. Fill the **Configure** form (server address, login, password, optional broker) → **Save**

   ![Configure fields](docs/images/mcpb-setup/06-configure.png)

7. Flip the toggle to **enable** it (it starts **Disabled**)

   ![Enable the extension](docs/images/mcpb-setup/07-enable.png)

Then ask Claude _"run a health check"_ to confirm. Full guide: **[Claude Desktop Setup](docs/CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md#one-click-install-claude-desktop-extension)**.

<summary><b>🖥️ Claude Desktop — manual setup (npx + config file) · screenshot walkthrough</b></summary>

<br>

Needs **Node.js**, **git**, and **Claude Desktop** installed.

1. Install **Node.js** (LTS) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), run the installer, then confirm the version in a terminal.

   ![Download Node.js](docs/images/claude-desktop-setup/01-node-download.png)
   ![Finish the Node.js installer](docs/images/claude-desktop-setup/02-node-installer-finish.png)
   ![Verify the Node.js version](docs/images/claude-desktop-setup/03-verify-node-version.png)

2. Install **git** from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com), then confirm it.

   ![Download git](docs/images/claude-desktop-setup/04-git-download.png)
   ![Verify the git version](docs/images/claude-desktop-setup/05-verify-git-version.png)

3. Install **Claude Desktop** from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download).

   ![Download Claude Desktop](docs/images/claude-desktop-setup/06-claude-desktop-download.png)

4. In Claude Desktop, open **Settings → Developer → Edit Config**.

   ![Settings → Developer → Edit Config](docs/images/claude-desktop-setup/07-settings-developer-editconfig.png)

5. Paste this in, filling the **three details from your broker** (your normal trading account login):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "trade-server": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "github:yourbourse/trade-server-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "YB_BASE_URL": "<your-server-url>",
           "YB_MODE": "client",
           "YB_LOGIN": "<your-login>",
           "YB_PASSWORD": "<your-password>"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   ![The config file with the trade-server block pasted in](docs/images/claude-desktop-setup/09-config-file-pasted.png)

6. **Fully quit and reopen** Claude Desktop.

   ![Quit Claude completely](docs/images/claude-desktop-setup/10-quit-claude-completely.png)

7. Confirm the trade-server tools appear.

   ![Tools listed under the tools icon](docs/images/claude-desktop-setup/11-tools-icon-listing.png)

8. Ask Claude _"run a health check"_ — a healthy status means you're connected.

   ![A successful health check](docs/images/claude-desktop-setup/12-health-check-result.png)

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 OpenAI Codex · screenshot walkthrough</b></summary>

<br>

Codex runs the MCP locally via `npx`. In Codex, open **Settings → MCP servers** and add a custom (STDIO) server.

1. Open Codex **Settings**.

   ![Open Codex settings](docs/images/codex-setup/01-open-settings.png)

2. Go to **MCP servers** and add a new server.

   ![MCP servers form](docs/images/codex-setup/02-mcp-servers-form.png)

3. Fill it in — name `trade-server`, command `npx` with args `-y github:yourbourse/trade-server-mcp`, and the four `YB_` environment variables (`YB_BASE_URL`, `YB_MODE=client`, `YB_LOGIN`, `YB_PASSWORD`) — plus the optional `YB_BROKER` if your broker requires it. **Save and fully restart Codex.**

   ![Filled-in Codex MCP form](docs/images/codex-setup/03-filled-form.png)

Full guide: **[Codex setup](docs/CODEX_SETUP.md)**.

</details>

**Once connected** (any method), ask your assistant _"Run a health check on the trade server."_ If it reports the server's time and version, you're set — ask for quotes, your balance, or to place a trade.

## What you can do

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Two modes, one server** | **Client mode** for traders (scoped to your own account) and **admin mode** for broker operations (server-wide) — detected from your sign-in (or pinned with `YB_MODE`) |
| **30 trader tools / 89 broker tools** | Task-shaped tools covering trading, account monitoring, market data, and (admin) server configuration, plus MCP resources for static context |
| **Live trading** | Market, Limit, Stop, StopLimit, and CloseBy orders with optional SL/TP; modify, cancel, partial close, flatten-everything composites |
| **Account monitoring** | Balance, equity, margin, unrealized P/L, open positions, working orders, trade and transfer history — single calls or one-shot summaries |
| **Market data & indicators** | Quotes, market depth, OHLCV candles, currency conversion; admin mode adds locally computed indicators (RSI, MACD, EMA, Bollinger Bands, and more) |
| **HMAC auth with auto-refresh** | Every write is HMAC-SHA256 signed; client login sessions refresh automatically before expiry — no manual token handling |
| **Safety by design** | Order-placing requests are never retried on connection errors (no duplicate fills); bulk tools report per-item outcomes; client sessions cannot touch other accounts |
| **Confirm before you trade** | Anything that moves money is a two-step **plan → commit** — your AI previews the order and nothing executes until you confirm |

---

## Trader or broker?

One process runs exactly one mode — the tool set is decided at startup from your credentials.

| | Client mode (traders) | Admin mode (brokers) |
|---|---|---|
| **Who it's for** | A trader with an account at a broker running a YourBourse Trade Server | The broker: operations and administration teams |
| **Scope** | Your own account only — the session token *is* the scope, enforced by the server | Server-wide: every account, group, client, routing rule, and liquidity connector |
| **Tools / resources** | 30 tools, 1 resource | 89 tools, 4 resources |
| **Credentials** | `YB_LOGIN` + `YB_PASSWORD` (or a pre-issued token pair) | Manager `YB_LOGIN` + `YB_PASSWORD`, or `YB_API_KEY` + `YB_SECRET_KEY` from the server admin panel |
| **Trading** | On your account; no account parameter exists | On behalf of any account via `accountId` |
| **Extras** | Rate-limit visibility, scoped balances | Cash transfers, order routing management, indicators, L1/L2 over WebSocket |

## Security

Your password is never transmitted — in client login mode it is used only as the local HMAC
signing secret for the sign-in request. Credentials live exclusively in your MCP client's
configuration and the server's process environment; nothing is ever written to disk, logged,
or echoed back to the AI. Order-placing requests are never retried on connection errors, so a
network blip cannot turn into a duplicate fill. The project ships **no npm package by
design**: distribution is npx straight from GitHub — the `main` branch by default, or a pinned tag
or commit for a reproducible build — never the npm registry, keeping the supply chain to four direct
runtime dependencies. Full details, recommended practices, and the vulnerability reporting
process are in [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).

<details>
<summary><b>For developers</b> — clone &amp; build, architecture, project layout, scripts</summary>

<br>

Most users never need this — the setup guides above are all you need to run the server. This
section is for reading or modifying the source.

### Run from a local clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourbourse/trade-server-mcp.git
cd trade-server-mcp
npm ci
npm run build
```

Then point your MCP client at the build with `"command": "node", "args": ["<path-to-repo>/dist/index.js"]`
and the same `env` block as above. (The no-clone `npx` install in the guides is recommended for
everyone else.)

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Entry point: parse config, build the auth provider and clients for the selected mode, register tools, connect stdio |
| `src/config.ts` | Environment-variable parsing: mode selection and inference, validation, startup error messages |
| `src/register-admin.ts` / `src/register-client.ts` | The single place where tool names and descriptions live, per mode |
| `src/rest-client.ts` | Signed REST client: HMAC headers, semantic error mapping, ETag caching, 401 renew-and-retry, transport retry policy |
| `src/ws-client.ts` | WebSocket client for live quotes and market depth (admin mode only) |
| `src/auth/` | HMAC-SHA256 signing, static key credentials, and the client login lifecycle with auto-refresh |
| `src/tools/admin/`, `src/tools/client/` | Tool implementations — a zod schema plus an async function per tool, grouped by category |

The full picture — mode selection, the life of a tool call, retry policy, and design decisions —
is in [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to `dist/` |
| `npm run dev` | Compile in watch mode |
| `npm test` | Build and run the full test suite (`node --test`) |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over the project |
| `npm run format` / `npm run format:check` | Prettier write / verify |
| `npm run type-check` | TypeScript type checking without emitting |
| `npm start` | Run the built server directly (stdio) |

### Live regression harness

`scripts/regression-admin.mjs` drives the **built** server over raw stdio JSON-RPC against a
real Trade Server — exactly like an MCP client would. Credentials come from the environment;
nothing is hardcoded:

```bash
# Admin mode
YB_API_KEY=... YB_SECRET_KEY=... YB_BASE_URL=... node scripts/regression-admin.mjs admin

# Client mode
YB_MODE=client YB_LOGIN=... YB_PASSWORD=... YB_BASE_URL=... node scripts/regression-admin.mjs client
```

Exit code 0 means all checks passed.
