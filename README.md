<br>

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that connects AI assistants
to a YourBourse Trade Server. Ask your AI to check your account, pull live quotes, place and
manage orders, or — in broker mode — operate across every account, group, and routing rule on
the server. No scripts, no copy-pasting API responses.

## Highlights

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Two modes, one server** | **Client mode** for traders (scoped to your own account) and **admin mode** for broker operations (server-wide) — selected by the credentials you configure |
| **26 trader tools / 38 broker tools** | Task-shaped tools covering trading, account monitoring, market data, and (admin) server configuration, plus MCP resources for static context |
| **Live trading** | Market, Limit, Stop, StopLimit, and CloseBy orders with optional SL/TP; modify, cancel, partial close, flatten-everything composites |
| **Account monitoring** | Balance, equity, margin, unrealized P/L, open positions, working orders, trade and transfer history — single calls or one-shot summaries |
| **Market data & indicators** | Quotes, market depth, OHLCV candles, currency conversion; admin mode adds locally computed indicators (RSI, MACD, EMA, Bollinger Bands, and more) |
| **HMAC auth with auto-refresh** | Every write is HMAC-SHA256 signed; client login sessions refresh automatically before expiry — no manual token handling |
| **Safety by design** | Order-placing requests are never retried on connection errors (no duplicate fills); bulk tools report per-item outcomes; client sessions cannot touch other accounts |
| **Zero codegen** | Every tool is hand-written with intent-rich descriptions your AI actually understands, and checked against the server's OpenAPI contract in tests |

---

## Quick Start

**No-clone install (recommended).** Node.js 18+ and git are all you need — your MCP client
fetches, builds, and runs the server straight from this repository, pinned to a release tag.
For a trader on Claude Desktop, add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trade-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "github:yourbourse/trade-server-mcp#v1.1.1"],
      "env": {
        "YB_BASE_URL": "https://<your-server-host>:<port>",
        "YB_MODE": "client",
        "YB_LOGIN": "<login>",
        "YB_PASSWORD": "<password>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `#v1.1.1` pin makes the install immutable — see [Security](docs/SECURITY.md) for why we
distribute from GitHub rather than the npm registry.

**Or clone and build** if you prefer a local checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourbourse/trade-server-mcp.git
cd trade-server-mcp
npm ci
npm run build
```

then use `"command": "node", "args": ["<path-to-repo>/dist/index.js"]` with the same `env`
block.

Broker administrators use `YB_MODE=admin` with `YB_API_KEY` / `YB_SECRET_KEY` instead. All
variables, both modes, and snippets for Claude Code and other MCP clients are in
[Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

**Finally, restart your MCP client** so it launches the server — then ask your AI:
*"What's my account state?"*

First time setting up? The [Getting Started guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) walks through
everything, including which credentials you need and how to verify the first tool call.

## Modes

One process runs exactly one mode — the tool set is decided at startup from your credentials.

| | Client mode (traders) | Admin mode (brokers) |
|---|---|---|
| **Who it's for** | A trader with an account at a broker running a YourBourse Trade Server | The broker: operations and administration teams |
| **Scope** | Your own account only — the session token *is* the scope, enforced by the server | Server-wide: every account, group, client, routing rule, and liquidity connector |
| **Tools / resources** | 26 tools, 1 resource | 38 tools, 4 resources |
| **Credentials** | `YB_LOGIN` + `YB_PASSWORD` (or a pre-issued token pair) | `YB_API_KEY` + `YB_SECRET_KEY` from the server admin panel |
| **Trading** | On your account; no account parameter exists | On behalf of any account via `accountId` |
| **Extras** | Rate-limit visibility, scoped balances | Cash transfers, order routing management, indicators, L1/L2 over WebSocket |

### Key Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Entry point: parse config, build the auth provider and clients for the selected mode, register tools, connect stdio |
| `src/config.ts` | Environment-variable parsing: mode selection and inference, validation, startup error messages |
| `src/register-admin.ts` / `src/register-client.ts` | The single place where tool names and descriptions live, per mode |
| `src/rest-client.ts` | Signed REST client: HMAC headers, semantic error mapping, ETag caching, 401 renew-and-retry, transport retry policy |
| `src/ws-client.ts` | WebSocket client for live quotes and market depth (admin mode only) |
| `src/auth/` | HMAC-SHA256 signing, static key credentials, and the client login lifecycle with auto-refresh |
| `src/tools/admin/`, `src/tools/client/` | Tool implementations — a zod schema plus an async function per tool, grouped by category |

The full picture — mode selection, the life of a tool call, retry policy, and design
decisions — is in [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to `dist/` |
| `npm run dev` | Compile in watch mode |
| `npm test` | Build and run the full test suite (85 tests, `node --test`) |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over the project |
| `npm run format` / `npm run format:check` | Prettier write / verify |
| `npm run type-check` | TypeScript type checking without emitting |
| `npm start` | Run the built server directly (stdio) |

### Live regression harness

`scripts/regression-admin.mjs` drives the **built** server over raw stdio JSON-RPC against a
real Trade Server — exactly like an MCP client would. Credentials come from the environment;
nothing is hardcoded:

```bash
# Admin mode
YB_API_KEY=... YB_SECRET_KEY=... YB_BASE_URL=... node scripts/regression-admin.mjs admin

# Client mode
YB_MODE=client YB_LOGIN=... YB_PASSWORD=... YB_BASE_URL=... node scripts/regression-admin.mjs client
```

Exit code 0 means all checks passed.

---

## Security

Your password is never transmitted — in client login mode it is used only as the local HMAC
signing secret for the sign-in request. Credentials live exclusively in your MCP client's
configuration and the server's process environment; nothing is ever written to disk, logged,
or echoed back to the AI. Order-placing requests are never retried on connection errors, so a
network blip cannot turn into a duplicate fill. The project ships **no npm package by
design**: distribution is npx from a pinned GitHub release tag, or clone + build — never
the npm registry — keeping the supply chain to four pinned runtime dependencies. Full details, recommended practices, and the vulnerability reporting
process are in [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).
