// Generic read-modify-write (edit), create and delete helpers for admin config resources.
//
// Every admin resource (symbols, groups, accounts, clients, liquidity connectors, …) shares one
// write contract, confirmed against the admin SDK:
//   - POST /admin/<res>/edit   — upsert; body = the full verbose object the get/query returns,
//     guarded by If-Match (ETag == the resource version).
//   - POST /admin/<res>/delete — body = { <res>Id, version }, also guarded by If-Match.
// RestClient keys ETags by request path, and the GET path differs from the write path, so the
// ETag captured with the read is carried onto the write here.
//
// These helpers back the per-resource, task-shaped tools (update_<res>_plan/commit,
// delete_<res>_plan/commit) — the tool names, schemas, and descriptions stay hand-written.
