## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Symbol writes (admin):** `update_symbol_plan` / `update_symbol_commit` — edit a symbol's server-wide configuration (any top-level fields via `updates`, and/or full `quoteSessions`/`tradeSessions` replacement lists) through a confirm-before-write flow. The plan reads the current symbol and returns a field-by-field diff plus a commit token; the commit applies it via `POST /admin/symbols/edit` (carrying the resource ETag as `If-Match` for optimistic concurrency).
- **Group writes (admin):** `update_group_plan` / `update_group_commit` (edit a trading group) and `delete_group_plan` / `delete_group_commit` (remove one) — same read-modify-write, confirm-before-write, ETag/If-Match pattern against `/admin/groups/edit` and `/admin/groups/delete`.
- **Config CRUD (admin):** edit + delete (confirm-before-write plan/commit) for **trading accounts** (`update_account_*`, `delete_account_*`), **clients** (`get_client`, `update_client_*`, `delete_client_*`), and **liquidity connectors** (`get_liquidity_connector`, `update_liquidity_connector_*`, `delete_liquidity_connector_*`), plus **`delete_symbol_*`**. All share one generic read-modify-write / delete helper (`resource-write.ts`) with ETag `If-Match` concurrency.
- **Trading calendar & manager admin (admin):** holidays (`get_holidays`, `get_holiday`, `update_holiday_*`, `delete_holiday_*`), managers (`get_managers`, `get_manager`, `get_manager_self`, `update_manager_*`, `delete_manager_*`), and `get_tokens` (list issued API tokens).
- **Create flows (admin):** `create_symbol_*`, `create_group_*`, `create_holiday_*`, `create_client_*`, `create_account_*` — clone an existing resource as a template (`fromId`) and/or pass a full `object`, apply `overrides`, and create it (id/version forced to 0, no If-Match) through the confirm-before-write plan/commit. A new trading account requires a user-supplied `password`.
- **Reporting and lookups (admin, read-only):** `get_journal` (server audit journal by time range, severity and message mask), `get_statements` (daily/monthly statements), `get_email_services`, `find_client_by_external_id`, `get_margin_call_accounts`, `get_transfer` (single transfer), `get_working_order` / `get_historical_order` (single order by ID), and `get_conversion_rates_batch`. Account-scoped tools take one of `accounts` / `groups` / `groupMasks`.
- **Position and trade record maintenance (admin):** `get_position`, `get_trade`, and confirm-before-write `update_position_*` / `delete_position_*` / `update_trade_*` / `delete_trade_*` for back-office corrections. These endpoints take a sparse `{ id, account, …changed }` update with no ETag concurrency, and their commits opt out of transport retries so a correction cannot be applied twice.
- **`create_manager_plan` / `create_manager_commit` (admin):** grant manager permissions to an account, optionally copying an existing manager via `fromId`. Previously only existing managers could be edited.
- Admin tool count 42 → 110.

### Changed

- **License changed from proprietary to Apache-2.0** — the project is now open source under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

### Fixed

- **Session renewal no longer gives up permanently after a transient failure.** A single failed token refresh/re-authorize used to leave the renewal timer un-armed, so the session silently died and every later request failed (as HTTP 502, not 401, on some servers) until the process was restarted. Renewal now re-arms with bounded exponential backoff (30s → 5m) until it recovers.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Automatic role detection for login/password sign-ins.** With no `YB_MODE` set, the server signs in and detects whether the account is a **manager** (admin tools) or a **trader** (client tools) — one configuration story for everyone. Detection is fail-closed: if it cannot confirm a manager, it starts in client mode (the role probe is capped at 5 seconds).
- **Admin mode via manager sign-in.** `YB_MODE=admin` (or auto-detection) now works with `YB_LOGIN`/`YB_PASSWORD` — a manager session that refreshes automatically, as an alternative to static API keys.
- `health_check` now reports the detected mode (client/admin) and, for login/password sign-ins, the account number — so you can always see which role was picked.

### Changed

- **The Claude Desktop extension is back to one credential set** — server address, login, password (+ optional broker). The API key/secret fields added in 2.1.0 are gone from the form; key-pair configuration remains available in manual/npx setups.
- **Upgrading the extension from 2.1.0:** if you configured an API key in 2.1.0, open Settings → Extensions → trade-server-mcp → Configure, enter your manager **login and password** (keep your admin server address), Save, and toggle the extension off/on. Your previously saved key/secret is no longer read.
- Login/password configurations without an explicit `YB_MODE` now perform one role-detection request at startup (previously they were assumed to be traders). A manager login that used to get trader tools now correctly gets admin tools. Set `YB_MODE=client` (or `admin`) explicitly to skip detection and keep exactly the previous behavior.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Manager/admin support in the one-click Claude Desktop extension (`.mcpb`).** The extension now works for both traders and managers/brokers and auto-detects which API to use from the credentials you enter: a **login + password** connects to the Public (trader) API, and an **API key + secret** connects to the Manager (admin) API — no mode setting required. The API key and secret are stored securely in your operating system's keychain.
- Documentation for changing your saved extension credentials (for example after a mistyped password).

### Changed

- The Claude Desktop extension's credential form no longer requires a login/password; managers can leave those blank and supply an API key/secret instead.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- `WsClient.connect()` now rejects (instead of hanging) when the socket closes before it opens — e.g. the server refuses the connection, or `disconnect()` is called mid-connect — so callers awaiting `connect()`/`ensureConnected()` no longer hang forever.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- WebSocket URL derivation now converts the base-URL scheme with an anchored, case-insensitive match, so an uppercase scheme (e.g. `HTTPS://`) — which passes config validation — no longer yields an invalid WebSocket URL.
- `getSnapshot` no longer uses an async Promise executor and is guarded against late-handler / double-cleanup races (a `settled` flag, a single restartable timer, and a best-effort `.catch`'d unsubscribe), so a subscribe rejection can never leak as an unhandled rejection.
- The `place_order_plan` completeness hint now lists all valid time-in-force values (`IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `Day`, `Ms`) instead of a subset, so it no longer implies the others are unsupported.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- **Preview accuracy for price-conditional orders.** `place_order_plan` (client and admin) now requires `limitPrice` for **Limit/StopLimit** orders and `stopPrice` for **Stop/StopLimit** orders before issuing a commit token, and the order preview no longer renders a price-conditional order as "@ market" when its price is missing. Previously such an order could be planned without its price and shown as a market order.
- The MCP server now reports its version from `package.json` instead of a hardcoded string (which had drifted out of sync with the release).

## [2.0.1] - 2026-06-30

### Security

- **Enforce secure transport for `YB_BASE_URL`.** The base URL is now validated at startup: `https://` is required by default to protect API credentials in transit, embedded `user:pass@` URL credentials are rejected, and malformed URLs fail with a clear message. A new opt-in `YB_ALLOW_INSECURE_BASE_URL` (`true`/`1`/`yes`) allows `http://` for local development only (other schemes such as `ws://` are still rejected).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- **BREAKING — trade execution is now two-step (confirm-before-execute).** The four one-shot money-mover tools (`place_order`, `close_position`, `close_by`, `close_all_positions`) are replaced by `*_plan` / `*_commit` pairs in both client and admin mode. `*_plan` validates and returns a preview (order summary + live quote + free margin) plus a single-use `commitToken` **without touching the market**; `*_commit` consumes the token and executes the unchanged order. This is what lets a non-technical user trade safely from Claude Desktop (preview → confirm → execute), and removes any un-gated execution path. Tool counts: client 26 → 30, admin 38 → 42.
- Reworded the HTTP 400/404 sign-in hint: it no longer asserts a wrong port as the cause, and instead points to invalid-parameter / stray optional field / wrong endpoint / server-side possibilities.

### Added

- Two-phase trade execution: a single-use commit token (5-minute TTL), an order preview (plain-language summary + live quote + free margin), actionable parameter-completeness messages ("here's exactly what's missing" instead of guessing), MCP tool annotations (`readOnlyHint` on `*_plan`, `destructiveHint` on `*_commit`), and an AI disclosure on commit.

### Fixed

- Client sign-in no longer fails when an optional config field is left blank: an unsubstituted `${...}` placeholder env value (injected by some MCP hosts for empty optional fields, such as `YB_BROKER`) is now treated as unset instead of sent as a literal value, which the server rejected with HTTP 400.
- `get_symbols` glob filter now matches the server's symbol-name field (`n`), so patterns like `EUR*` return results instead of an empty list.
- WebSocket: an explicit `disconnect()` is now terminal and no longer triggers a reconnect loop; pending requests are rejected promptly on close instead of hanging (Issue #9).
- Admin trading: order-creating operations no longer retry on a transport error, matching client mode and preventing duplicate execution (Issue #9).
- WebSocket `getSnapshot` now rejects on a subscribe failure instead of silently returning empty data, so callers can distinguish "no data" from "subscription failed" (Issue #9).

### Security

- `get_quotes` (client and admin) now caps the `symbols` array at 50 and runs at most 8 upstream lookups concurrently, preventing unbounded fan-out / self-DoS (Issue #8).
- All REST calls now enforce a request timeout (default 10s, configurable via `YB_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`), reported as a stable `TIMEOUT` error. Timeouts are never auto-retried, preserving duplicate-fill protection on order placements (Issue #8).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-10

### Security

- Bumped `ws` to 8.21.0 (GHSA-58qx-3vcg-4xpx) and refreshed transitive dependencies via `npm audit fix` — `npm audit` is clean.

### Changed

- The npx no-clone install is now the primary configuration shown in all documentation examples.
- Supply-chain policy wording updated to cover both distribution forms (pinned npx tag, clone + build).
- The regression script no longer assumes a specific account; set `REGRESSION_ACCOUNT_ID` to enable the account-info check.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Client (trader) mode with 26 tools against the public Trade Server API.
- Two client authentication styles: login+password with automatic token refresh, and static public API token.
- Duplicate-fill protection: order-placement POSTs never retry on connection errors.
- Targeted sign-in failure diagnostics surfaced in tool results (credential, server-version, and connectivity hints).
- 85-test suite using node:test, including golden HMAC vectors.
- stdio JSON-RPC regression harness (`scripts/regression-admin.mjs`) supporting both admin and client modes.

### Changed

- Admin mode is unchanged at 38 tools.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Initial internal release: admin mode with 38 tools — trading, account management, market data with locally computed technical indicators, server configuration — plus 4 MCP resources.
