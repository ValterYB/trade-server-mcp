# Configuration

This guide covers every environment variable the Trade Server MCP understands, how the server
decides which mode to run in, and ready-to-paste configuration examples for Claude Desktop,
Claude Code, and any other MCP-compatible client.

If this is your first time setting up the server, start with [Getting Started](./GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Environment variable reference

All configuration is passed through environment variables. Values are trimmed of leading and
trailing whitespace, and a variable set to an empty (or whitespace-only) string is treated as
unset.

| Variable | Applies to | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `YB_BASE_URL` | All modes | Yes | Base URL of your YourBourse Trade Server, including the scheme and port, with no trailing slash — for example `https://<your-server-host>:<port>`. The MCP appends `/api/v1/...` to this URL for every request. **The port depends on the mode**: the client (public) API and the admin API are served on different ports of the same Trade Server — use the client port for client mode and the admin port for admin mode; your broker or server operator tells you which is which. |
| `YB_MODE` | All modes | Recommended | `admin` or `client`. Optional when the mode can be inferred from your credential variables (see below), but always safe to set explicitly. |
| `YB_API_KEY` | Admin mode, or client mode with a token pair | Yes, in those setups | The API key (public half of the key pair) issued for your account. |
| `YB_SECRET_KEY` | Admin mode, or client mode with a token pair | Yes, in those setups | The secret key (signing half of the key pair). It is used only to sign requests locally and is never transmitted. |
| `YB_LOGIN` | Client mode with login/password | Yes, in that setup | Your trading account number. Must be a positive integer. |
| `YB_PASSWORD` | Client mode with login/password | Yes, in that setup | Your trading account password. It is used only as the local signing secret for the sign-in request — it is never sent over the network, logged, or echoed. |
| `YB_BROKER` | Client mode with login/password | No | Your broker's company name, sent along with the sign-in request. Only needed if your broker tells you to set it (for example, when one server hosts more than one broker). |

## Mode selection and inference

There are three working setups:

1. **Admin mode** — for broker administrators. Uses a static admin key pair
   (`YB_API_KEY` + `YB_SECRET_KEY`). Server-wide access.
2. **Client mode, login/password** — for traders. Signs in with `YB_LOGIN` + `YB_PASSWORD`
   (plus `YB_BROKER` if your broker requires it) and manages its session token automatically.
3. **Client mode, token pair** — for traders who have been issued a public API token pair by
   their broker. Uses `YB_API_KEY` + `YB_SECRET_KEY` with `YB_MODE=client`.

The mode is decided in this order of precedence:

1. If `YB_MODE` is set, it wins. Valid values are `admin` and `client`.
2. Otherwise, if `YB_LOGIN` or `YB_PASSWORD` is set, the mode is inferred as **client**.
3. Otherwise, if `YB_API_KEY` or `YB_SECRET_KEY` is set, the mode is inferred as **admin**.
4. Otherwise, startup fails with a configuration error.

Two notes worth remembering:

- **If you mix credential variables, set `YB_MODE` explicitly.** A token pair
  (`YB_API_KEY`/`YB_SECRET_KEY`) without `YB_MODE` is taken to mean admin mode — so client
  token setups must include `YB_MODE=client`.
- In client mode you must pick **one** credential style. Setting both `YB_LOGIN`/`YB_PASSWORD`
  and `YB_API_KEY`/`YB_SECRET_KEY` is rejected at startup.

## Configuration examples

The examples below use placeholders — replace `<your-server-host>:<port>`, `<api-key>`,
`<secret-key>`, `<login>`, `<password>`, `<broker-company-name>`, and
`<path-to-repo>` (the folder where you cloned this repository) with your own values.
On Windows, write paths in JSON with doubled backslashes, e.g.
`"C:\\Users\\you\\trade-server-mcp\\dist\\index.js"`.

Build the project first (`npm ci && npm run build`) so that `dist/index.js` exists —
see [Getting Started](./GETTING_STARTED.md).

### Setup 1: Admin mode (broker administrators)

**Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trade-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<path-to-repo>/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "YB_BASE_URL": "https://<your-server-host>:<port>",
        "YB_MODE": "admin",
        "YB_API_KEY": "<api-key>",
        "YB_SECRET_KEY": "<secret-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code** — one-liner:

```bash
claude mcp add trade-server \
  --env YB_BASE_URL=https://<your-server-host>:<port> \
  --env YB_MODE=admin \
  --env YB_API_KEY=<api-key> \
  --env YB_SECRET_KEY=<secret-key> \
  -- node <path-to-repo>/dist/index.js
```

**Claude Code** — or declare it in your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trade-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<path-to-repo>/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "YB_BASE_URL": "https://<your-server-host>:<port>",
        "YB_MODE": "admin",
        "YB_API_KEY": "<api-key>",
        "YB_SECRET_KEY": "<secret-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Setup 2: Client mode, login/password (traders)

**Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trade-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<path-to-repo>/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "YB_BASE_URL": "https://<your-server-host>:<port>",
        "YB_MODE": "client",
        "YB_LOGIN": "<login>",
        "YB_PASSWORD": "<password>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If your broker told you to set a broker name, add `"YB_BROKER": "<broker-company-name>"`
to the `env` block.

**Claude Code** — one-liner:

```bash
claude mcp add trade-server \
  --env YB_BASE_URL=https://<your-server-host>:<port> \
  --env YB_MODE=client \
  --env YB_LOGIN=<login> \
  --env YB_PASSWORD=<password> \
  -- node <path-to-repo>/dist/index.js
```

**Claude Code** — or declare it in your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trade-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<path-to-repo>/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "YB_BASE_URL": "https://<your-server-host>:<port>",
        "YB_MODE": "client",
        "YB_LOGIN": "<login>",
        "YB_PASSWORD": "<password>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Setup 3: Client mode, token pair (traders with an issued API token)

`YB_MODE=client` is **required** here — without it, a key pair is interpreted as admin mode.

**Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trade-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<path-to-repo>/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "YB_BASE_URL": "https://<your-server-host>:<port>",
        "YB_MODE": "client",
        "YB_API_KEY": "<api-key>",
        "YB_SECRET_KEY": "<secret-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code** — one-liner:

```bash
claude mcp add trade-server \
  --env YB_BASE_URL=https://<your-server-host>:<port> \
  --env YB_MODE=client \
  --env YB_API_KEY=<api-key> \
  --env YB_SECRET_KEY=<secret-key> \
  -- node <path-to-repo>/dist/index.js
```

**Claude Code** — or declare it in your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trade-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<path-to-repo>/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "YB_BASE_URL": "https://<your-server-host>:<port>",
        "YB_MODE": "client",
        "YB_API_KEY": "<api-key>",
        "YB_SECRET_KEY": "<secret-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Other MCP clients

Any MCP-compatible client that supports stdio servers can run the Trade Server MCP. Configure it
to launch the command `node <path-to-repo>/dist/index.js` over the **stdio** transport, with the
environment variables from whichever setup above matches your situation. There is no HTTP/SSE
endpoint — the server communicates exclusively over stdin/stdout, and writes its log lines to
stderr.

## Startup error messages

If the configuration is invalid, the server exits at startup with one of the messages below.
Every message is followed by this help text:

```
Trade Server MCP configuration:
  Admin mode  (brokers): YB_BASE_URL + YB_API_KEY + YB_SECRET_KEY [+ YB_MODE=admin] (set YB_MODE explicitly if mixing credential variables)
  Client mode (traders): YB_BASE_URL + YB_LOGIN + YB_PASSWORD [+ YB_BROKER] + YB_MODE=client
  Client mode (token):   YB_BASE_URL + YB_API_KEY + YB_SECRET_KEY + YB_MODE=client
```

| Error message | What to do |
|---|---|
| `Missing YB_BASE_URL.` | Set `YB_BASE_URL` to your Trade Server's URL, e.g. `https://<your-server-host>:<port>`. Remember that an empty or whitespace-only value counts as unset. |
| `Admin mode requires YB_API_KEY.` | You are in admin mode (explicitly, or inferred from `YB_SECRET_KEY`) but `YB_API_KEY` is missing. Add it, or switch to a client setup. |
| `Admin mode requires YB_SECRET_KEY.` | Same as above, but the secret half of the pair is missing. Add `YB_SECRET_KEY`. |
| `Client mode: set either YB_LOGIN/YB_PASSWORD or YB_API_KEY/YB_SECRET_KEY, not both.` | You provided both credential styles in client mode. Remove the pair you do not intend to use. |
| `Client login mode requires YB_LOGIN.` | You set `YB_PASSWORD` but not `YB_LOGIN`. Add your account number. |
| `YB_LOGIN must be a positive integer (got "<value>").` | `YB_LOGIN` must be your numeric account number — digits only, no spaces or letters. |
| `Client login mode requires YB_PASSWORD.` | You set `YB_LOGIN` but not `YB_PASSWORD`. Add your account password. |
| `Client token mode requires both YB_API_KEY and YB_SECRET_KEY.` | In client token mode, both halves of the token pair are required. Add the missing one. |
| `Client mode requires credentials.` | `YB_MODE=client` is set but no credentials were found. Add either `YB_LOGIN` + `YB_PASSWORD` or `YB_API_KEY` + `YB_SECRET_KEY`. |
| `Unknown YB_MODE "<value>". Valid values: admin, client.` | `YB_MODE` must be exactly `admin` or `client` (lowercase). Fix the value. |
| `No mode could be inferred — set either YB_API_KEY + YB_SECRET_KEY (admin) or YB_LOGIN + YB_PASSWORD (client).` | `YB_BASE_URL` is set but no credential variables are. Add credentials for the mode you want. |

When startup fails this way, the process prints `Fatal error:` followed by the message above to
stderr and exits with code 1. Where to find your MCP client's stderr log is covered in
[Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Startup log lines

On a healthy start, the server writes one mode line to stderr, then a final ready line. These
are the exact strings to look for:

**Admin mode:**

```
Trade Server MCP: admin mode (server-wide tools)
```

**Client mode, login/password, sign-in succeeded** (the account number is your `YB_LOGIN`):

```
Trade Server MCP: client mode, signed in as account <login>
```

**Client mode, login/password, sign-in failed** — the server still starts, registers all tools,
and retries sign-in on each tool call. `<hint>` is a targeted diagnosis of the failure
(wrong credentials, server version, or connectivity — see
[Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)):

```
Trade Server MCP: client mode — sign-in FAILED. <hint> Tools are registered; calls will retry sign-in.
```

**Client mode, token pair:**

```
Trade Server MCP: client mode (public API token)
```

**Always, once the server is ready:**

```
Trade Server MCP running on stdio
```
