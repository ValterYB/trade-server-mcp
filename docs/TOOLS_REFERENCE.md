# Tools Reference

The complete reference for every tool the Trade Server MCP exposes, in both modes:

- **[Client mode](#client-mode-30-tools)** — 30 tools, all scoped to your own trading account.
- **[Admin mode](#admin-mode-98-tools)** — 98 tools with server-wide scope, for broker
  administrators.

For each tool you'll find the description your AI sees (verbatim, as registered with the MCP
server), a parameter table, and one realistic example call. Tools are grouped by category.
Each mode also exposes [MCP resources](#resources-client-mode), listed at the end of its
section. Differences between same-named tools in the two modes are summarized in
[Cross-mode differences](#cross-mode-differences).

Setup is covered in [Getting Started](./GETTING_STARTED.md) and
[Configuration](./CONFIGURATION.md). Persona guides: [Admin Mode](./ADMIN_MODE.md),
[Client Mode](./CLIENT_MODE.md).

> **Conventions used below:** all times are **microseconds since epoch** unless stated
> otherwise. Quantities are in **lots**. Example values are placeholders — substitute your own
> account, order, and position IDs.

## Client mode (30 tools)

Every client-mode tool operates on **your account only** — there is no `accountId` parameter
anywhere, because your sign-in token already identifies the account.

### Trading (13 tools)

The four money-movers — placing an order, closing a position, a hedged close, and closing
everything — are **confirm-before-execute**: each is a `*_plan` + `*_commit` pair. The `*_plan`
tool validates the request and returns a plain-language preview (summary, live quote, free margin)
plus a single-use `commitToken` (valid ~5 minutes) **without touching the market**; the `*_commit`
tool takes only that token and executes the previewed order. Nothing reaches the market until you
commit.

#### `place_order_plan`

> STEP 1 of placing an order — preview a new order on YOUR account WITHOUT executing. Validates the request and returns a plain-language summary, the live quote, your free margin, and a commitToken. Show the preview to the user; ONLY after they confirm, call place_order_commit with that token. If required details are missing (symbol, side, quantity, order type, time-in-force) it returns exactly what's needed instead of guessing. Nothing is sent to the market.

All order parameters are optional at the plan step — if any required detail is missing, the tool reports exactly what's needed instead of guessing. On success it returns a `preview` (summary, live quote, free margin) and a single-use `commitToken`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `symbol` | string | No | Symbol name, e.g. EURUSD |
| `side` | `"buy"` \| `"sell"` | No | Order side |
| `quantity` | number (positive) | No | Volume in lots, e.g. 0.1 |
| `orderType` | `"Market"` \| `"Limit"` \| `"Stop"` \| `"StopLimit"` | No | Order type |
| `timeInForce` | `"FOK"` \| `"IOC"` \| `"GTC"` \| `"GTD"` \| `"Day"` \| `"Ms"` | No | Time in force. Use IOC or FOK for Market orders |
| `limitPrice` | number | No | Limit price (for Limit/StopLimit) |
| `stopPrice` | number | No | Stop price (for Stop/StopLimit) |
| `stopLoss` | number | No | Stop loss price |
| `takeProfit` | number | No | Take profit price |
| `comment` | string | No | Order comment |

Example:

```json
{
  "symbol": "EURUSD",
  "side": "buy",
  "quantity": 0.1,
  "orderType": "Market",
  "timeInForce": "IOC",
  "stopLoss": 1.0750,

  "comment": "breakout entry"
}
```

#### `place_order_commit`

> STEP 2 — execute the order previewed by place_order_plan. Requires the commitToken from that preview; the order is fixed at plan time and cannot be changed here. This places a LIVE order via an AI assistant — only call after the user has reviewed the preview and explicitly confirmed.

### Resources (client mode)

Client mode registers **1 MCP resource**:

## Admin mode (98 tools)

Admin-mode tools have **server-wide scope**: tools that act on an account take an `accountId`
parameter, and read tools can query across all accounts. See [Admin Mode](./ADMIN_MODE.md) for
the persona guide.

### Trading (21 tools)

The four money-movers — placing an order, closing a position, a hedged close, and closing
everything — are **confirm-before-execute**: each is a `*_plan` + `*_commit` pair. The `*_plan`
tool validates the request (admin money-movers always need the target `accountId`) and returns a
plain-language preview plus a single-use `commitToken` (valid ~5 minutes) **without touching the
market**; the `*_commit` tool takes only that token and executes the previewed order. Nothing
reaches the market until you commit.

Show the preview; only after the user confirms, call place_order_commit. Nothing is sent.

All parameters are optional at the plan step — if any required detail (including `accountId`) is missing, the tool reports exactly what's needed instead of guessing.

| `orderType` | `"Market"` \| `"Limit"` \| `"Stop"` \| `"StopLimit"` | No | Order type |
| `timeInForce` | `"FOK"` \| `"IOC"` \| `"GTC"` \| `"GTD"` \| `"Day"` \| `"Ms"` | No | Time in force. Use IOC or FOK for Market orders |
| `limitPrice` | number | No | Limit price (for Limit/StopLimit) |
| `stopPrice` | number | No | Stop price (for Stop/StopLimit) |
| `stopLoss` | number | No | Stop loss price |

Both parameters are optional at the plan step; if `accountId` is missing the tool reports what's needed. On success it returns a `preview` and a single-use `commitToken`. High-impact: the disclosure names the blast radius.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `accountId` | number | No | Trading account ID |
| `symbol` | string | No | Only close positions for this symbol |

Example:

```json
{
  "accountId": 12345
}
```

#### `close_all_positions_commit`

> STEP 2 — execute the close-all previewed by close_all_positions_plan. Requires the commitToken. LIVE and high-impact (closes every matching position) — only after explicit user confirmation.

Executes the close-all previewed by `close_all_positions_plan`. Takes only the token.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `commitToken` | string | Yes | The commitToken returned by close_all_positions_plan |

Example:

```json
{
  "commitToken": "plan_a7b8c9d0-1e2f-4a3b-9c6d-7e8f9a0b1c2d"
}
```

#### `close_by_plan`

> STEP 1 — preview a hedged close (two opposite positions on the same symbol) on a client account WITHOUT executing; returns a commitToken. Needs accountId + positionId + positionById. Show the preview; only after the user confirms, call close_by_commit. Nothing is sent.

All parameters are optional at the plan step; any missing required field is reported back. On success it returns a `preview` and a single-use `commitToken`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `accountId` | number | No | Trading account ID |
| `positionId` | number | No | Position ID to close |
| `positionById` | number | No | Opposite position ID to close against |

Example:

```json
{
  "accountId": 12345,
  "positionId": 67890,
  "positionById": 67891
}
```

#### `close_by_commit`

> STEP 2 — execute the hedged close previewed by close_by_plan. Requires the commitToken. Places a LIVE close — only after explicit user confirmation.

Executes the hedged close previewed by `close_by_plan`. Takes only the token.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `commitToken` | string | Yes | The commitToken returned by close_by_plan |

Example:

```json
{
  "commitToken": "plan_c2d3e4f5-6a7b-4c8d-9e0f-1a2b3c4d5e6f"
}
```

#### `modify_order_sltp`

```json
{
  "accountId": 12345,
  "orderId": 67890,
  "takeProfit": 1.0950
}
```

#### `force_delete_order`

> Force-delete a stuck or corrupted order that normal cancel cannot remove. Admin safety net — use only when cancel_order fails. This bypasses normal order lifecycle.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `accountId` | number | Yes | Trading account ID |
| `orderId` | number | Yes | Order ID to force-delete (removes stuck/corrupted orders that normal cancel can't remove) |

Example:

```json
{
  "accountId": 12345

| `accountId` | number | Yes | Trading account ID (login) |

Example:

```json
{
  "accountId": 12345

Example:

```json
{
  "accountId": 12345

No parameters.

Example:

```json
{}
```

#### `cash_transfer_plan`

> STEP 1 of a cash transfer (deposit / withdrawal / adjustment) on a client account — preview WITHOUT executing. Validates and returns the account, amount, direction, and type plus a commitToken; if required details are missing (account, amount, type) it returns exactly what's needed. Positive amount = deposit, negative = withdrawal. Show the preview; only after the user confirms, call cash_transfer_commit. Nothing is moved.

All parameters are optional at the plan step — if any required detail (account, amount, type) is missing, the tool reports exactly what's needed instead of guessing. On success it returns a `preview` (summary naming the target account, amount, direction, and type) and a single-use `commitToken`. **No money moves at this step.**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

  "accountId": 12345,
  "amount": 1000,
  "type": "Balance",
  "currency": "USD",
  "comment": "initial deposit"
}
```

#### `cash_transfer_commit`

> STEP 2 — execute the cash transfer previewed by cash_transfer_plan. Requires the commitToken from that preview. This moves REAL money irreversibly via an AI assistant — only call after the user has reviewed the preview and explicitly confirmed.

Executes the transfer previewed by `cash_transfer_plan`. Takes only the token; the transfer details (account, amount, direction, type) were fixed at plan time and cannot be changed here. **This moves real money and cannot be undone.**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `commitToken` | string | Yes | The commitToken returned by cash_transfer_plan |

Example:

```json
{
  "commitToken": "plan_d6e7f8a9-0b1c-4d2e-8f4a-5b6c7d8e9f0a"

No parameters.

Example:

```json

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `groupId` | number | Yes | Group unique identifier |

Example:

```json
{
  "groupId": 1

{}
```

#### `get_order_routing`

> Get current order routing configuration. Shows all routing rules with their filters and actions. Returns version number needed for set_order_routing.

No parameters.

Example:

```json
{}
```

#### `set_order_routing`

> Replace ALL order routing rules at once. Requires the current version number (get from get_order_routing). CAUTION: this overwrites everything. Prefer add_routing_rule/remove_routing_rule for safe atomic changes.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `version` | number | Yes | Current routing config version (get from get_order_routing) |
| `routing` | array of rule objects | Yes | Array of routing rules |
| `routing[].a` | array of objects | Yes | Actions array (e.g. [{type:'Execute',connectorId:1}]) |
| `routing[].f` | array of objects | No | Filters array (optional) |

Example:

```json
{

    {
      "a": [{ "type": "Execute", "connectorId": 1 }],
      "f": [{ "type": "Symbol", "value": "EURUSD" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `add_routing_rule`

> Add a single routing rule to the existing configuration without affecting other rules. Safer than set_order_routing. Automatically reads current version and appends.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `actions` | array of objects | Yes | Actions array (e.g. [{type:'Execute',connectorId:1}]) |
| `filters` | array of objects | No | Filters array (optional, e.g. [{type:'Symbol',value:'EURUSD'}]) |

  "actions": [{ "type": "Execute", "connectorId": 1 }],
  "filters": [{ "type": "Symbol", "value": "EURUSD" }]
}
```

#### `remove_routing_rule`

> Remove a single routing rule by its zero-based index. Use get_order_routing first to see current rules and their indices. Safer than set_order_routing.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `index` | number | Yes | Zero-based index of the routing rule to remove (use get_order_routing to see current rules) |

Example:

```json

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `symbolId` | number | Yes | Symbol unique identifier |

Example:

```json
{
  "symbolId": 42
}
```

#### `update_symbol_plan`

> STEP 1 of editing a symbol's server-wide configuration — preview WITHOUT writing. Reads the current symbol (by symbolId from get_symbols), applies your partial changes (any top-level fields via `updates`, and/or full `quoteSessions`/`tradeSessions` replacement lists), and returns a field-by-field diff plus a commitToken. Show the diff; only after the user confirms, call update_symbol_commit. Nothing is written.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `symbolId` | number | Yes | ID of the symbol to modify (from get_symbols) |
| `updates` | object | No | Partial map of top-level symbol fields to overwrite, using the exact field names get_symbols returns (e.g. `{ "bidMarkup": 5, "maxOrderSize": 50 }`). For sessions use quoteSessions/tradeSessions instead. |
| `quoteSessions` | array of `{weekDay,start,end}` | No | Full replacement list of quote sessions (repeat a weekday for intraday breaks). Omit to leave unchanged. |
| `tradeSessions` | array of `{weekDay,start,end}` | No | Full replacement list of trade sessions. Omit to leave unchanged. |

Example:

```json
{
  "symbolId": 70,
  "tradeSessions": [
    { "weekDay": "Mon", "start": "01:05:00", "end": "23:50:00" },
    { "weekDay": "Fri", "start": "01:05:00", "end": "23:50:00" }
  ]
}
```

#### `update_symbol_commit`

> STEP 2 — apply the symbol edit previewed by update_symbol_plan. Requires the commitToken from that preview. Writes a LIVE, server-wide change to the symbol via an AI assistant — only call after the user has reviewed the diff and explicitly confirmed.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `commitToken` | string | Yes | The commitToken returned by update_symbol_plan |

Example:

```json
{
  "commitToken": "plan_6eee4ff4-9cdc-4780-9b66-977cb0084b53"
}
```

#### Resource CRUD (create / edit / delete) — the shared pattern

All admin config resources below expose **create / edit / delete** through the same
confirm-before-write **plan → commit** pairs as `update_symbol_*`:

- **`update_<res>_plan`** reads the current object (by id), applies your partial `updates`, and
  returns a field-by-field diff plus a `commitToken`. **`update_<res>_commit`** applies it via
  `POST /admin/<res>/edit`, sending the resource's ETag as `If-Match` (optimistic concurrency).
- **`delete_<res>_plan`** previews the target; **`delete_<res>_commit`** posts
  `{ <res>Id, version }` to `/admin/<res>/delete` with `If-Match`.
- **`create_<res>_plan`** builds a new object — clone an existing one as a template via `fromId`
  (recommended) and/or pass a full `object`, then apply `overrides`; `id`/`version` are forced to
  `0`. **`create_<res>_commit`** posts it to `/admin/<res>/edit` (no `If-Match`).

Every `*_plan` returns a `commitToken`; every `*_commit` takes only `{ commitToken }`. Nothing is
written until you commit. Field names in `updates`/`overrides` are exactly those the matching
`get_*` returns.

| Resource | Read | Create | Edit | Delete |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Symbols** | `get_symbols`, `get_symbol_details` | `create_symbol_plan/commit` | `update_symbol_plan/commit` | `delete_symbol_plan/commit` |
| **Groups** | `get_groups`, `get_group` | `create_group_plan/commit` | `update_group_plan/commit` | `delete_group_plan/commit` |
| **Trading accounts** | `get_all_accounts`, `get_account_info` | `create_account_plan/commit` ¹ | `update_account_plan/commit` | `delete_account_plan/commit` |
| **Clients** | `get_clients`, `get_client` | `create_client_plan/commit` | `update_client_plan/commit` | `delete_client_plan/commit` |
| **Liquidity connectors** | `get_liquidity_connectors`, `get_liquidity_connector` | — | `update_liquidity_connector_plan/commit` | `delete_liquidity_connector_plan/commit` |
| **Holidays** (trading calendar) | `get_holidays`, `get_holiday` | `create_holiday_plan/commit` | `update_holiday_plan/commit` | `delete_holiday_plan/commit` |
| **Managers** | `get_managers`, `get_manager`, `get_manager_self` | via `update_manager` (id 0) | `update_manager_plan/commit` | `delete_manager_plan/commit` |
| **Access tokens** | `get_tokens` | — | — | — |

¹ A new trading account **requires a `password`** in `overrides`/`object` (supplied by you).

**Plan parameters** — edit: `{ <res>Id, updates }`; delete: `{ <res>Id }`; create:
`{ fromId?, object?, overrides? }`. **Commit parameters** — `{ commitToken }`.

Example — clone `EURUSD` (id 1) into a new `EURGBP`:

```json
{
  "fromId": 1,
  "overrides": { "name": "EURGBP", "path": "Forex/EURGBP", "description": "Euro vs Pound" }
}
```

### Reporting and lookups (read-only)

Added alongside the CRUD tools; all are plain reads.

| Tool | What it does | Key parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `get_journal` | Server audit journal over a time range — who changed what, plus server events. Answers "who modified this symbol and when". | `fromTime`, `toTime` (microseconds since epoch), optional `severities` (`trace`…`critical`), `mask`, `maxResults` |
| `get_statements` | Daily/monthly account statements for a date, optionally with orders and positions. | `type` (`Daily`/`Monthly`), `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), optional `accounts`/`groups`/`groupMasks`, `orders`, `positions` |
| `get_email_services` | Configured email-service (notification) configurations. | none |
| `find_client_by_external_id` | Find a client by the external ID your systems assigned. | `clientExternalId` |
| `get_margin_call_accounts` | Accounts currently in margin call. | optional `accounts`/`groups`/`groupMasks`, `maxResults`, `sortOrder` |
| `get_transfer` | One cash transfer by ID. | `transferId` |
| `get_working_order` | ONE pending order by ID (list: `get_working_orders`). | `orderId` |
| `get_historical_order` | ONE completed/cancelled order by ID (list: `get_order_history`). | `orderId` |
| `get_conversion_rates_batch` | Several conversion rates in one call (single pair: `get_conversion_rate`). | `rates`: array of `{ groupId, from, to }` |

Account-scoped tools take **one** of `accounts` (IDs), `groups` (IDs) or `groupMasks` (e.g. `["Real/*"]`); the first one supplied wins, and omitting all means server-wide.

Example — audit trail for the last hour, warnings and worse:

```json
{
  "fromTime": 1786426492000000,
  "toTime": 1786430092000000,
  "severities": ["warning", "error", "critical"],
  "maxResults": 50
}
```

### Utility (1 tool)

#### `health_check`

> Check if Trade Server is running and responsive. Returns current server time, which mode this server runs in (manager/admin) and, when signed in with a manager login/password, the account number. Use to verify connectivity before other operations.

No parameters.

Example:

```json
{}
```

Example response (manager login/password sign-in):

```json
{
  "now": "2026-07-02T14:25:12.610779+00:00",
  "version": "25.1.167",
  "mode": "admin",
  "account": 1
}
```

`account` appears only for login/password sign-ins; static key/token setups report mode only.

### Resources (admin mode)

Admin mode registers **4 MCP resources**:

| Resource | URI | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `symbols` | `trade://symbols` | List of all available trading symbols with IDs and names |
| `groups` | `trade://groups` | List of all trading groups |
| `accounts` | `trade://accounts` | List of all trading accounts |
| `connectors` | `trade://connectors` | List of all liquidity connectors |

---

## Cross-mode differences

Many tools share a name across the two modes but are not identical. The differences that
matter in practice:

- **No `accountId` in client mode — ever.** Your sign-in token already identifies your
  account, so client-mode tools have no account parameter at all. In admin mode, every tool
  that acts on an account requires (or accepts as a filter) an `accountId`.

- **`get_balances` means different things.** In client mode it returns **your account's
  balances/collateral per asset**. In admin mode it returns the **financial state (balance,
  equity, margin, P/L) of every account on the server** — a portfolio-level overview.

- **`get_symbol_details` looks up by name vs by ID.** The client API looks symbols up by
  **name** (`symbolName`, e.g. `"EURUSD"`); the admin API looks them up by numeric
  **`symbolId`** (use `get_symbols` first to find it).

- **`get_quote`, `get_quotes`, and `get_market_depth` use different transports.** In client
  mode these are plain REST requests. In admin mode they stream from the server's
  **WebSocket** market-data feed (L1 for quotes, L2 for depth) and accept an optional
  `groupId` to select the pricing context (default 1).

- **`get_candles` symbol selection differs.** Client mode takes `symbolName` only. Admin mode
  takes either a `symbolId` or a `symbolName` + `groupId` pair.

- **`get_conversion_rate` group context.** Admin mode requires an explicit `groupId`; client
  mode uses your account's group automatically.

- **`marginCheck` is admin-only.** Admin `place_order_plan` can disable the margin check
  (`marginCheck: false`); client orders are always margin-checked by the server.

- **Client-only tool:** `get_limits` (your session's API rate limits) exists only in client
  mode. The 14 admin-only tools are listed in [Admin Mode](./ADMIN_MODE.md#admin-only-tools).

- **Resources:** client mode exposes 1 resource (`trade://symbols`, scoped to your account);
  admin mode exposes 4 (`trade://symbols`, `trade://groups`, `trade://accounts`,
  `trade://connectors`).
